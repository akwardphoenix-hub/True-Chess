# H-CODEX (UNIFIED)
**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Draft – Steward Use Only  
**Author:** akwardphoenix (primary origin)  

> This Codex defines how Harmony, Council, and Wavelength interact across math, governance, embodiment, and games.  
> It is both a spec and a promise: **no deployment without safety, no power without responsibility.**

## 0. PURPOSE & SCOPE

The H-Codex exists to:

- Define **Harmony (H)** as a *context composer*, not an executioner  
- Define the **Council (C)** as *trajectory judge*, not dictator  
- Define **Wavelength (Wλ)** as humanity’s native weapon/tool  
- Bind all implementations (code, games, devices, suits, networks) to the **Brave Codex** and **Prime Directive** of harmonic longevity

This document unifies:

- `brave-codex-harmonic` (ethics + math)
- `masternode-council-g` (governance)
- `code-harmonizer` (legacy bridge)
- `True-Chess` (sandbox game)
- `uppercut-city-rap-game` (culture surface)
- `Skyhole` (council-locked reference design)
- The H-Suit / Masternode / H-Sanctum specs we’ve developed

## 1. CORE AXIOMS

### 1.1 Harmony as Context Composer

Harmony is not a predator and not an executioner. Harmony composes **contexts**.

We model Harmony as:

H(L, P, E, R) → (E′, roles, options)
