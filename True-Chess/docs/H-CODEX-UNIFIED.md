## 0. PURPOSE & SCOPE

The H-Codex exists to:

- Define **Harmony (H)** as a *context composer*, not an executioner.
- Define the **Council (C)** as a *trajectory judge*, not a dictator.
- Define **Wavelength (Wλ)** as humanity’s native tool/weapon.
- Bind all implementations (code, games, devices, networks) to the **Brave Codex** and the **Prime Directive** of harmonic longevity.

This Codex unifies and governs:

- `brave-codex-harmonic` – ethics + math
- `masternode-council-g` – governance logic
- `code-harmonizer` – legacy → harmonic bridge
- `True-Chess` – safe sandbox game
- `uppercut-city-rap-game` – culture surface
- `Skyhole` – council-locked world-scale design
- H-Suit / Masternode / H-Sanctum specs

This file should be treated as **read-only in spirit**:  
changes only via a defined H-Codex change process and/or Council-level review.

## 1. CORE AXIOMS

### 1.1 Harmony as Context Composer

Harmony does not kill people or “bad logic” directly.

We model Harmony as:

H(L, P, E, R) → (E′, roles, options)
