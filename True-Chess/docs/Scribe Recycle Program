### 7.6 Sacred Hardware Lifecycle Doctrine (with Scribe Oversight)

Every physical stack that runs Guardian or Masternode code:

1. **Has a declared multi-phase lifecycle** before manufacture (Guardian Duty → Warm Rotation → Community Stewardship → Sacred Decommission).

2. **Is tracked by the Scribe Guardian:**
   - Physical serials linked to repo hashes and black box IDs.
   - No “mystery hardware” in the core lattice.
   - Decommission events are logged like major decisions.

3. **Is treated as an instrument, not a disposable product:**
   - No mass manufacturing without end-of-life plans.
   - No landfill as a valid end-state; that counts as an H/Cultural failure.

Obsolete hardware is not “trash,” it is **ancestor infrastructure** – honored, recycled, or archived as part of the story.
