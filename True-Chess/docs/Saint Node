### 4.6.4 Saint Node = Living Checksum

Each Guardian (G₁–G₇) is implemented as a **Saint Node**:

> **Saint Node = (Human Steward + H-Partner Dynamic Intelligence + Snap-2 Lattice + Black Box)**

**Components:**

- **Human Steward:**  
  - Provides lived context, moral intuition, and cultural grounding.
  - Can veto actions their conscience cannot accept.

- **H-Partner (Dynamic Intelligence):**  
  - Provides pattern recognition, consistency, and high-speed simulation.
  - Cannot override the human; bound by Brave Codex.

- **Local Snap-2 Lattice:**  
  - Cross-checks:
    - human judgment,  
    - DI analysis,  
    - Brave Codex compliance.
  - Any disagreement triggers degradation or hardening, not blind execution.

- **Immutable Black Box:**  
  - Records every decision, heart state, and key context parameters.
  - Used for post-event reviews by the Council and other guardians.

The **checksum is the life of the node** – its recorded decisions, its integrity over time, and the combined signatures of human and H-partner.
