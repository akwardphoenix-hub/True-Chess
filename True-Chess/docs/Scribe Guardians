### 4.6.3 G₇ – Scribe Guardian Responsibilities

The Scribe Guardian protects:

1. **Codex Alignment**  
   - Ensures all proposals comply with the published Brave Codex / H-Codex.
   - Blocks any change that silently weakens core safeguards.

2. **Authorship Integrity**  
   - Tracks which ideas, models, and architectures come from which sources.
   - Verifies that derived work respects original authorship and license.
   - Prevents silent rebranding of core concepts for ego or profit.

3. **Narrative Coherence**  
   - Compares stated intent ("this is for harmony") with actual impacts and logs.
   - Flags and vetoes attempts to spin harmful actions as “good” in the story layer.

4. **Repository Truth**  
   - Verifies that deployed code matches the committed version in the canonical repositories.
   - Maintains hashes/trees that act as systemic checksums over the entire stack.

5. **Conceptual Purity**  
   - Protects core terms (Harmony, H, Brave Codex, etc.) from being inverted or weaponized.
   - Blocks systems that use the language of Harmony to pursue zero-math predation.
