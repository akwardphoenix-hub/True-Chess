### 4.6.5 Decision Flow Through the Seven Guardians

Given a proposed action `A`:

1. **L-Check (Love):**  
   - Compute L(A): does this action show real care for living beings?
   - If L(A) < threshold → reject immediately.

2. **Front Triad (G₁–G₃ – Operators):**  
   - Each Saint Node evaluates A in its domain.  
   - At least 2-of-3 must approve with no hard veto.

3. **Back Triad (G₄–G₆ – Auditors):**  
   - Each Saint Node evaluates A from long-term and systemic perspectives.  
   - At least 2-of-3 must approve with no hard veto.

4. **Central Harmony Check (H):**  
   - H verifies that A, when embedded into the current environment, increases H-trajectory and does not violate safe manifolds.

5. **Scribe Guardian (G₇):**  
   - Verifies codex alignment, authorship legitimacy, narrative coherence, and repository integrity.
   - Has absolute veto on truth, story, and attribution.

6. **Living Checksum Commit:**  
   - If all layers approve, a composite checksum is generated and committed.
   - That checksum is now part of the system’s permanent memory of itself.
